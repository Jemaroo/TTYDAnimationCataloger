# TTYDAnimationCataloger
A tool to extract animation data from TTYD's and SPM's animation files

UPDATED (8/23/22): Fixed a few bugs with recognizing names, added functions for the additional animation slots tool (can be toggled on and off by uncommenting a line)

Huge thanks to PistonMiner for documentation and tools on TTYD's animation formats https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools

USE INSTRUCTIONS:
Still being worked on, but if anyone wants to use it, you enter the direct file paths in inputFilePath and outputFilePath variables and then run the program.
