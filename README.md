# TTYDAnimationCataloger
A tool to extract animation data from TTYD's and SPM's animation files

UPDATED (8/28/22): Full release version Fixed a bug where some 0's would be missing from the animation data offset values, made the script a jar file to easily run with a batch, removed older versions
 
UPDATED (8/23/22): Fixed a few bugs with recognizing names, added functions for the additional animation slots tool (can be toggled on and off by uncommenting a line)

Huge thanks to PistonMiner for documentation and tools on TTYD's animation formats https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools
