# TTYDAnimationCataloger
A tool to extract animation data from TTYD's and SPM's animation files

Huge thanks to PistonMiner for documentation and tools on TTYD's animation formats https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools

USE INSTRUCTIONS:
Still being worked on, but if anyone wants to use it, you enter the direct file paths in inputFilePath and outputFilePath variables and then run the program.
