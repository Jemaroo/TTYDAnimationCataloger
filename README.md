A tool to extract animation data from TTYD's and SPM's animation files

UPDATED (8/28/22): Full release version
  -Fixed a bug where some 0's would be missing from the animation data offset values
  -Made the script a jar file to easily run with a batch
  -Removed Older Versions

UPDATED (8/23/22): Fixed a few bugs with recognizing names, added functions for the additional animation slots tool (can be toggled on and off by uncommenting a line)
