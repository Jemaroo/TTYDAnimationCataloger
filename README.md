# TTYDAnimationCataloger
A tool to extract animation data from TTYD's and SPM's animation files

I also have been posting the extracted information with descriptions here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D-M9QLmiZRplz35xYeh3wlsSt9IPH8Jb?usp=drive_link 

UPDATED (10/4/23): Moved the excel file into a new Combined folder, when run, will also combine all the csvs into a seperate file as well as individually. Fixed another issue where larger Call Names wouldn't display, it should now work for all lengths.

UPDATED (9/27/23): Fixed an issue where smaller Call Names wouldn't display.

UPDATED (5/24/23): Finished adding compatibility for converting an entire folder at once, bug fixes.

UPDATED (11/25/22): Fixed a bug where some 0's would be missing from the initial animation data location values.

UPDATED (8/28/22): Full release version Fixed a bug where some 0's would be missing from the animation data offset values, made the script a jar file to easily run with a batch, removed older versions
 
UPDATED (8/23/22): Fixed a few bugs with recognizing names, added functions for the additional animation slots tool (can be toggled on and off by uncommenting a line)

Huge thanks to PistonMiner for documentation and tools on TTYD's animation formats https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools
